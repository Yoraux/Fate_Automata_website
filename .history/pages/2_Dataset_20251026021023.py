st.write("""
Using the dataset provided by the authors (see link below), we trained our model based on images collected and prepared in the bone marrow laboratory of Taleqani Hospital, Tehran, Iran. 
This dataset includes 3,256 peripheral blood smear (PBS) images obtained from 89 patients suspected of having Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). 
All samples were prepared and stained by experienced laboratory technicians. The dataset is categorized into two main classes: **benign** and **malignant**. 
The benign class consists of hematogones, while the malignant class represents the ALL group, which is further divided into three subtypes: **Early Pre-B**, **Pre-B**, and **Pro-B ALL**.
